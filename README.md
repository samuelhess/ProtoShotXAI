# ProtoShotXAI
This repository provides the training and algorithm demonstration for the paper
[ProtoShotXAI: Prototypical Few-Shot Architecture for Explainable AI.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11597)

We are still in the process of updating this repository so please be patient and check back soon for additional instructions-- 6/21/2022

### Getting Started
Install dependencies (I prefer a conda environment)
- `conda create -n ProtoShotXAI python=3.6`
- `conda activate ProtoShotXAI`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python -m ipykernel install --user --name ProtoShotXAI`
- `python setup.py develop` (or `python setup.py install` if you don't want to do development)
Download trained models for XAI
- trained models are available for public download at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L2LsaWgq5l-YPuIU-m1QIFuS2YJZ3eKn/view?usp=sharing
- unzip file to base directory (i.e., ./trained_models/)
